## About
I'm a versatile quantitative researcher. I regularly use R, SQL, MATLAB, and Python for different problem-solving or analytic tasks at hand. I'm experienced with advanced statistical analysis (e.g., linear mixed effect models, structural equation models, time series analysis) 

## Flagship Projects
