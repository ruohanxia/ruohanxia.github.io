# Ruohan Xia

I am a data-driven researcher well trained in human-centered cognitive science and analytics. With 7+ years of experience designing rigorous studies and analyzing complex behavioral and physiological data, I specialize in turning evidence into insights, and insights into action. 

My background spans academic research in psychology and neuroscience as well as applied data analytics, combining statistical rigor, thoughtful reserach design, and clear data storytelling. I am motivated by work that bridges theory and practice - using data to answer meaningful questions, inform theories and decisions, and create measurable impact across research, product, and policy contexts.
