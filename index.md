Hi, I'm Ruohan Xia. 

I'm a data- and research-driven scientist working at the intersection of analytics, human behavior, and applied research. 

With 7+ years of experience designing rigorous studies and analyzing complex human behavioral and physiological data, I specialize in turning evidence into insight and insights into action. My background spans academic research in psychology and neuroscience, as well as applied data analytics, combining statistical rigor, thoughtful research design, and clear data storytelling. 

I am motivated by work that bridges theory and practice - using data to answer meaningful questions, inform decisions, and create measurable impact across research, product, and policy contexts.
