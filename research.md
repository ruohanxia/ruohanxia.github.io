## Research Focus
My research explores the neural and caregiving mechanisms supporting the development of emotion perception and understanding. I am particularly interested in uncovering the neural correlates that are involved in processing real-time affective stimuli presented by opposing social partners. I use a combination of electroencephalorgam (EEG)/event-related potentials (ERP), surveys, and semi-structured behavioral coding methods to form comprehensive dataset.
