## About
I am a developmental cognitive neuroscientist. I think about the brain and how different factors may contribute to the individual differences in its development. My primary neuroscientific method is electroencephlography (EEG), and I examine resting-state and event-related spectral power, as well as event-related potentials (ERPs). 

I have two lines of research interest: 
1) To understand the development of affective processing, and
2) To estbalish best practices that aim to improve the methodological rigor, accuracy, and efficiency in the field of developmental cogntive neuroscience. 

## Ongoing Projects
### 1. Neural and caregiver mechanisms supporting infants' emotion perception in the first years of life.
The ability to perceive emotions is central for successful human interactions, and individual differences in this critical ability lead to adaptive or maladpative social behaviors. However, factors that contribute to such indivdiual differences are currently unknown. In this project, I take an ecologically valid approach to examine infants' neural correlates in response to caregivers' real-time emotional displays, and aim to uncover longitudinal links between caregiver characteristics and infants' neural and behavioral manifestation of emotion perception. 

### 2. Optimizing processing parameters for responsible developmental neuroscientific approach. 
The field of developmental cognitive neuroscience sits at an exciting yet uncertain intersection. While the use of EEG has enabled researchs across the world to explore the neural mechanisms supporting various developmental constructs, the lack of standardized processing and analysis paramters poses unique threat to the replicability of the field. In this project, I use both simulated and collected data to compare different processing pipelines (e.g., HAPPE, MADE, NEAR) to establish a set of processing parameters and a set of recommendations for future researchers.
