## About
I am a developmental cognitive neuroscientist. I think about the brain - its structure and function - and how different factors may contribute to the individual differences in its development. 

I have two lines of research interest: 
1) To understand the development of affective processing, and
2) To estbalish best practices that aim to improve the methodological rigor, accuracy, and efficiency in the field of developmental cogntive neuroscience. 

## Ongoing Projects
### 1. Neural and caregiver mechanisms supporting infants' emotion perception in the first years of life.
I examine infants' 
### 2. Optimizing developmental EEG

## Methods
### Electroencephalogram (EEG)
- Event-related potentials (ERP)
- Spectral power
- Funcational connectivity
### Quantitative analysis:
- Structural equation models
- Linear mixed effects models
- General/generalized regressions
- ANOVA
- T-tests
### Surveys
### Qualitative behavioral coding
