## About
I am a developmental cognitive neuroscientist. I think about the brain, how it develops, and how different factors may contribute to the individual differences in its development to support more complex social cognition such as emotion perception and understanding. My primary neuroscientific method is electroencephlography (EEG), and I examine resting-state and event-related spectral power, as well as event-related potentials (ERPs). 

I have two lines of research interest: 
1) To understand the development of affective processing, and
2) To estbalish best practices that aim to improve the methodological rigor, accuracy, and efficiency in the field of developmental cogntive neuroscience. 


## Ongoing Projects
### 1. Neural and caregiver mechanisms supporting infants' emotion perception in the first years of life.
The ability to perceive emotions is central for successful human interactions, and individual differences in this critical ability lead to adaptive or maladpative social behaviors. However, factors that contribute to such indivdiual differences are currently unknown. While theories suggest the foundamental involvement of the brain as well as the caregiving environment in supporting emotion perception, existing studies rely on computer-administered paradigms which does not resemble real-life interactions. 

In this project, I take an ecologically valid approach to examine infants' neural correlates in response to caregivers' real-time emotional displays during naturalistic caregiver-infant interactions. I aim to uncover concurrent and longitudinal links between caregiver characteristics and infants' neural and behavioral manifestation of emotion perception. 

### 2. Optimizing processing parameters for responsible developmental neuroscientific approach. 
The field of developmental cognitive neuroscience sits at an exciting yet uncertain intersection. While the use of EEG has enabled researchs across the world to explore the neural mechanisms supporting various developmental constructs, the lack of standardized processing and analysis paramters poses unique threat to the replicability of the field. Many existing automated pipelines offer some guidance, but due to the vast varaibility in developmental EEG (depending on how it was collected, experimenter degrees-of-freedom, infant characteristics), these guidelines do not provide the analytic support researchers need to select the most optimal processing parameters to yield clean and unbiased data.  

In this project, I use both simulated and collected data to compare different processing pipelines (e.g., HAPPE, MADE, NEAR) and their proposed paramter suggestions. I aim to establish a set of processing parameters and a parameter selection tutorial for future researchers to make informed decisions about data processing and enhance replicability.
